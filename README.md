This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis of cases.<br/>
This is conducted to sharpen my EDA and business knowledges regarding the case.<br/>
The library utilized are mostly Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.<br/>

## Cases
1. E-Commerce
  - Problems:
    A company reduces all the price of 7 different product categories, such as: Athletic Shoes, Casual & Dress Shoes, Eyewear, Perfumes & Fragrances, Sportswear, Wallets, Watches. By reducing the price, the company expects to increase the percentage of unit sold, yet the profit will also reduce, ceteris paribus. Does rating increase after reducing the price of the product categories? Which product categories are favored by the consumers when the price is reduced? Dataset contains more than 50% null values. Therefore, the imputation will be conducted in the EDA.
  - Aims:
    Finding 3 product categories which is favorable/more percentage of unit sold after price reduction. Additionally, the categories are the products that gain the less profit but the unit sold is increasing. Therefore, those 3 products could be evaluated, so that the company wouldn't loose more revenue and the unit sold will reach the target.
